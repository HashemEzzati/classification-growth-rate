    <h1>This project is divided into two parts:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Get OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data of cryptocurrencies from Binance by connecting to the Binance API and storing 	them in MongoDB.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate a deep learning classification model to predict growth rates.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 1:</h2>
    <p>In the first part, initially, the financial data of the desired market is fetched by calling an API within a specified time frame (by default, Bitcoin data in an hourly time frame from 2020 to June 2023) and stored in MongoDB.</p>
    <h2>Part 2:</h2>
    <p>In the second part of the project, using Python and the PyMongo library, a local query is executed to retrieve the relevant information from the database, which is then sorted and made available to the model.</p>
    <p>Since the API calling part is implemented with Node.js, and the model generation is performed using Python, the necessary dependencies for each programming language and their usage in their respective files have been specified.</p>
    <p>You can see the final results in an HTML file that was generated by Bokeh, an interactive library in Python for visualization.
